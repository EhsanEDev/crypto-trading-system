# SOLUSDT — 4h Regime Report

Regime Detector v001 (rule-based hypothesis, no lookahead).

## Dataset

- Symbol: `SOLUSDT`
- Timeframe: `4h`
- Start: `2022-04-17 16:00:00+00:00`
- End: `2026-09-24 00:00:00+00:00`
- Rows: **9723**
- Missing candles (gaps): **0**
- Duplicate candles: **0**
- OHLC anomalies (exchange-reported inconsistencies): **77**
- Misaligned timestamps: **0** | NaN/infinite values: **0**

## Data quality
- Quality gate: **NOT READY (strict validation failed: gaps/OHLC anomalies/misalignment)**
- Candle policy: **closed-only** — in-progress candles are never persisted as history; the last stored candle is refreshed (replaced) on re-download if the exchange revised it.
- OHLC anomalies are kept as received (audit trail), never silently repaired; strict validation refuses them for research use.

## Indicator summary

| Indicator | Defined | NaN (warm-up) | Mean | Min | Max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EMA50 | 9674 | 49 | 100.6412 | 10.3378 | 247.7356 |
| EMA200 | 9524 | 199 | 100.8733 | 12.5558 | 226.2890 |
| ATR14 % | 9709 | 14 | 2.8514 | 0.7495 | 28.0172 |
| RSI14 | 9709 | 14 | 50.0568 | 12.2439 | 91.5406 |
| ADX14 | 9696 | 27 | 27.7664 | 8.0686 | 72.0489 |

> Warm-up (TA-Lib-compatible conventions): EMA slow needs `ema_slow - 1` bars, ADX needs `2*period - 1` bars (first ADX at bar 27 for period 14), RSI/ATR need `period` bars. Early NaNs are expected and never filled.
